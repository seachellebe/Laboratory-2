**Lab Exercise 2 – Array Initialization**
Objective: Practice initializing arrays during declaration.

**Instructions:**
1. Write a program that declares and initializes an array sales as follows:
    double sales[] = {12.25, 32.50, 16.90, 23.00, 45.68};
2. Display all the elements using a loop.
3. Add code to calculate and display the average sales.
4. Modify the initialization to include only three values. Observe the results.

**Questions:**
- What values are assigned to the uninitialized elements?
- What happens if you specify a size smaller than the number of initial values?
